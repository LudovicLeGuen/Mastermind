## User testing 
Special thanks to the following who tested and gave me their feedback and ideas to improve the game:
* Callum Dennis (who held weekly calls and reviewed my work each time)
* Gary Grant (who guided me when I was lost)
* Ed Bradley (whose invaluable insight got me out of trouble more than once)
* Christopher Undritz (for spending so much time on reviewing my code and finding an important bug)
* Roger Pf√§ffli (who is always a source of wisdom and fun)
* Owonikoko Oluwaseun my mentor (the funniest and loveiest person. Cannot thank her enough for the guidance)

And last, but definitely not the least!
* My wife Domnika (who suffered me during the stressful times. Could not do it without her)
